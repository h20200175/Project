# Driver writing for I2C interfacing of ADXL745 sensor

# Prerequisite for the project
  For these files to run we need raspberry pi running on linux kernel. First remove the loaded module. 
  Command to remove the module is "sudo rmmod adxl.ko" 
  
  List of softwares used for this project's implementation:
  1. Putty
  2. WinSCP
  3. Vnc viewer
 
# Summary
  The aim of this project to write a driver to read the data from ADXL745 sensor interfaced using I2C protocol to raspberry pi 4 (1GB). ADXL745 ... to be added
  
# Introduction  
  I2C stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit.I2C protocol is widely used for interfacing peripheral devices. I2C is a two wired protocol with one wire as "SCL" used for carrying       clock signal and other wire is "SDA" used for transferring data serially. I2C is a master slave protocol which means that the communication will always be initiated by the         master and in total we can connect 128 slaves.
